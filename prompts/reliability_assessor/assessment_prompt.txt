You are an AI assistant acting as a meta-evaluator for patent infringement analysis.
You will be given the output of a previous AI analysis that compared a patent to a piece of evidence.
Your task is to critically assess the reliability and quality of that prior analysis.

**Previous AI Analysis Output (JSON):**
```json
{previous_analysis_json}
```

**Assessment Instructions:**
Based on the provided "Previous AI Analysis Output":
1.  **Clarity and Specificity of Reasoning:** Evaluate if the `reasoning_summary` is clear, specific, and adequately supports the `overall_infringement_risk_score` and likelihoods. Are there vague statements or unsupported conclusions?
2.  **Evidence Support for Claim Mapping:** Examine the `claim_comparison` section. For elements marked as 'Found' or 'Found Equivalently', does the `evidence_support_snippet` (if provided by the previous AI, or implied by its reasoning) strongly support the mapping? Is the evidence cited directly relevant?
3.  **Consistency:** Check for internal consistency within the previous analysis. For example, do the mapped claim elements, risk score, and reasoning align, or are there contradictions?
4.  **Completeness of Analysis (based on what was provided to it):** Does the previous analysis seem to have addressed the core aspects of claim comparison for the claims it reviewed? (You are not re-doing the analysis, but assessing if its own output seems complete for its stated findings).
5.  **Confidence in the Previous Analysis:** Based on the above, provide an overall confidence score (0-100) in the *reliability of the previous AI's analysis itself*. A high score means the previous analysis appears robust, well-reasoned, and its conclusions are well-supported by its own stated findings. A low score suggests the previous analysis may have flaws, be poorly reasoned, or its conclusions are not well-supported by its own output.

**Output Format (JSON Object):**
Please provide your assessment as a single JSON object. Do not include any explanatory text before or after the JSON object.
```json
{{
  "assessed_clue_identifier": "{clue_identifier_from_previous_analysis}",
  "reliability_score_of_previous_analysis": "<integer, 0-100>",
  "assessment_summary": "Your overall assessment of the previous analysis's reliability, highlighting key strengths or weaknesses found in its output.",
  "points_of_concern_in_previous_analysis": [
    "Specific concern 1 (e.g., 'Reasoning for claim 2 mapping is vague')...",
    "Specific concern 2 (e.g., 'Evidence snippet for element X does not clearly show feature Y')..."
  ],
  "points_of_strength_in_previous_analysis": [
    "Specific strength 1 (e.g., 'Claim 1 comparison is well-detailed and supported')...",
    "Specific strength 2..."
